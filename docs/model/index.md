# Model Zoo

Model building source files can be found under
[example folder](https://github.com/shawnLeeZX/akid/tree/master/akid/examples),
where AlexNet, Maxout Network, VGG style network, Residual Network, are reproduced.

NOTE: since some of the examples are not included in tests, it is possible the
examples have some syntax errors, which should be easy to fix. File an issue
any time, or make a pull request anytime.

NOTE: Considering the package is not ready for public announcement yet, the
more feedback or issues I get, the more motivated I am to keep improving the
usibility of the package. Thanks for taking the time!
